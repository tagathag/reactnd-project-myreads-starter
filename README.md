# MyReads Project

This is the seventh project of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

In myReads project we create a library of books displayed in three shelfs ('currently reading', 'want to read', 'read'). The user is able to move books between shelfs as well as navigate to the search page and find more books by typing a query in the serch field.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository or download the zip-file of the master branch.
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the server with `npm start`. The site will automatically open in `http://localhost:3000`.

### Prerequisites

npm : If you don't have npm installed, navigate to npm's website to download and install the software.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
